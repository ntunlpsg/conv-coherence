I've used mcafee. It drove me nuts. I've used norton. Also drove me nuts. ZoneAlarm worked nearly flawlessly (as well as windows can.) It is a very stable and intuitive program that is what I have been looking for. All I can is that you should buy this and get rid of whatever you're using now, especially if it's Mcafee or norton. Just a sidenote: I run AVG free antivirus alongside this and I also ran it alongside norton and mcafee. AVG would catch things that neither Norton nor mcafee would. Never have had that problem with ZoneAlarm
